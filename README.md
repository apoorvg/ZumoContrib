SQL Server and SQL Compact Stores for Microsoft Azure Mobile Services
===========

This project contains the two sample offline stores for use with [Microsoft Azure Mobile Services Offline Sync]. 

These sample local store implementations can be used as an alternative to using SQLite especially for desktop applications (WPF, WinForms) that would rather use SQLCE or SQL Server-based stores.

To use SQLite, you would normally open the local store like this:
```sh
  var store = new MobileServiceSQLiteStore("localsync.db");
```

MobileServiceSqlCeStore 
----
- for use with SQL Compact (SQL CE)

To use SQL CE as an offline store, use the line below instead:
```sh
  var store = new MobileServiceSqlCeStore(@"Data Source=c:\<yoursqlcompactdbhere>.sdf");
```

Note: If the SQL CE database doesn't exists, it will automatically be created.  


MobileServiceSqlStore
----

 - for use with SQL flavors (SQL Server/Express/LocalDb/AzureSql)

To use SQL Server-based local store, use the line below:

```sh
  var store = new MobileServiceSqlStore(@"Data Source=<yourserver>;Initial Catalog=<yourdb>;Integrated Security=SSPI;");
```  
  
Note: Unlike the SQLite and SQLCE local stores, the SQL Server Database must already exists.
